# Home page

Trying to build a simple home page with a search and some links to be hosted locally

## ToDo
 
1. Setup mobile view  
2. Dynamically adjust the number of grid rows based on screen width  
3. Create site icon

### Maybe

1. Colourscheme  
2. Dynamically build from yaml / json config file  
3. Multiple search options from the search bar  
OR Change search URL from config file
4. Adjust grid border / gaps to keep cards centered on larger screens
